Title: An R packaged zlib-1.2.5
Version: 1.41.0
Author: Martin Morgan
Maintainer: Bioconductor Package Maintainer <maintainer@bioconductor.org>
Description: This package uses the source code of zlib-1.2.5 to create
  libraries for systems that do not have these available via other
  means (most Linux and Mac users should have system-level access to
  zlib, and no direct need for this package). See the vignette for
  instructions on use.
